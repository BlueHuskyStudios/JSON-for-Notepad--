Features
========
- Utilizes the oft ignored background color to help the minimal syntax of JSON stand out.
- Invalid values are blatantly hilighted in a red background and white text
- Automatically activates on files with the `.json` extension

Instructions
============
1. Obtain `JSON.xml` by clicking "releases" up top, by cloning this reposiory, or by getting it straight from the `lib` folder
2. Open Notepad++
3. Open the "Language" menu
4. Select "Define your language..."
5. Click "Import..."
6. Navigate to and select `JSON.xml`
7. Select "OK" on the "Import successful" dialog and close the "User Defined Language" dialog/panel
8. Enjoy!

If you need to manually select the JSON hilighter for any reason, it should appear near the bottom of the "Languages" dropdown as "JSON".

**You may need to restart Notepad++ for JSON to show up in the language menu and automatically be applied to JSON files.**
